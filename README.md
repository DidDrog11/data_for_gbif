# Data for GBIF

This repository is to clean and organise the data from a paper published on rodent trapping across [West Africa](https://github.com/DidDrog11/scoping_review).

The field names are available from a GBIF template and descriptions of the fields here (https://www.gbif.org/data-quality-requirements-occurrences).
