# Data for GBIF

This repository is to clean and organise the data from a paper published on rodent trapping across [West Africa](https://github.com/DidDrog11/scoping_review).

The field names are available from a GBIF template and descriptions of the fields here (https://www.gbif.org/data-quality-requirements-occurrences).

This repository includes the code to pull down the data from the Google sheets document that was used for data extraction, clean the underlying data and format it in the structure required for GBIF for both the pathogen and rodent species'.
